title: Problems selecting points in instanced geometry.
desc: |-
  Steps to reproduce:
  
  * Start K-3D.
  * Create a PolyCube.
  * Right click on the cube and choose Instantiate.
  * Use the Translate Tool to offset the new instance so it doesn't overlap with the original.
  * Choose Select > Points.
  * Try to select some points in the new instance - doesn't work.
  * Choose Select > Nodes.
  * Shift-click on the original instance so both instances are selected.
  * Choose Select > Points.
  * Try to select some points in the original instance - corresponding points in both instances are selected.
  * Choose Select > Edges.
  * Make selections in both instances - works fine.

  - Turning-off K3D_BUILD_ADVANCED_OPENGL_PAINTERS fixes this issue, need to figure-out where things are going wrong ... VBO point painters?
