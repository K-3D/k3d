title: 5 Rotate manipulator works wrong on multiple viewports
desc: "Having multiples viewports makes the rotate manipulator work wrong.\n\n\
  Steps:\n\
  1-Create several viewports\n\
  2-Try to manipulate an object on one viewport other that the \"main\"\n\
  viewport\n\
  3-The selected manipulator is chosen as if the user were clicking on the\n\
  \"main\" viewport (using the current user coordinates to select the\n\
  manipulator on the \"main\" viewport coordinates).\n\n\
  I guess this should also happen to the move and rotate manipulator.\n\n\
  Cheers!\n\
