title: NGUI startup fails on FreeBSD.
desc: |-
  During startup on FreeBSD 8, initialization of the user interface plugin fails, generating the following error message:
  
  CRITICAL: Caught exception [std::runtime_error] - UI plugin module [/home/jared/k3d-build/lib/k3d/plugins/k3d-ngui.module] does not implement k3d::iuser_interface
  *** Error code 1
  
  ... this error means that a dynamic_cast to k3d::iuser_interface is failing, which should never happen since we know that the NGUI does, in fact, implement k3d::iuser_interface.
