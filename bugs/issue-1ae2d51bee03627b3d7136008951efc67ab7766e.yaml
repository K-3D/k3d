title: GUI widgets to help users know direction and orientation of lights.
desc: |-
  All lights that are directional, including those with maps need a
  visual clue in the 3D view-port as to their orientation, even if it is
  fixed. Mapping an environment light's EXR file to the back of the
  veiw-port would be ideal, but in truth a luxury. All that is needed a
  simple arrow or other way of showing where the map's 0,0 point is and
  it's orientation.
