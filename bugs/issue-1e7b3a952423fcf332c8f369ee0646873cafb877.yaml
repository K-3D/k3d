title: "5  Python Script: bug on Document.delete_node() "
desc: "Steps:\n\n\
  1- Select a node (A) property on connect it to another's node property\n\
  (B).\n\
  2- Delete node B from the python engine.\n\
  3- Node A property is still connected to node B property although B doesn't\n\
  exist anymore.\n\n\
  I attach an example file.\n\
  1- Open test_doc.k3d\n\
  2- select polycube instance (the cube on the right)\n\
  3- run the delete_selected_instance.py\n\n\
  Go and see the input_mesh property of MeshInstance node.\n\
  It can't be disconnected unless you connect it first to other node.\n\n\
  Cheers!\n\
