  Summary: Problems with rendering
  Report Generated: 2007-Aug-14 20:26:51 UTC
  Package: k3d
  Version: 0.6.6.0
  Platform: i486-pc-linux-gnu
  Compiler: 4.1.2 20070106 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.1-21ubuntu7)
  Build Time: Jan 16 2007 15:55:06 local
  Description of problem:
  The program often simply crashes when F12 is pressed. Changing the preview
  engine is often
  not reflected. Trying to create a preview simply does nothing.
  
  Steps to reproduce problem:
  
  1. Add a cone in the viewport
  2. Press F12 and try the same with engines (the program said I did not have
  any installed)
  
  Expected results:
  Either a result or an error
  
  Actual results:
  Program crashes or does absolutely nothing
  
  How often does this happen?
  Always
  
  Additional information:
  The program simply says that some engine executable is missing (only once
  in the runtime).
  Thereafter neither an error nor a result is seen.
