title: "User properties Order and NullOutputScript "
desc: |-
  On 0.7 rev 899, ubuntu feisty fawn
  
  When user properties are created via script, when the file is reloaded,
  they are reordered missing it's original order. (this doesn't happen on
  manually created user properties)
  
  NullOutputScript
  When opening a file it evaluates its script before its user properties are
  created.
  I guess is has to do with /scripting/null_output_script.cpp
  line 51: connect_script_changed_signal(sigc::mem_fun(*this,
  &null_output_script::on_execute));
