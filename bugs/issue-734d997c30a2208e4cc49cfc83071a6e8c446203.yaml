  Report Generated: 2008-Jun-17 02:45:04 UTC
  Package: k3d
  Version: 0.6.7.0
  Platform: i686-pc-mingw32
  Compiler: 3.4.4 (mingw special)
  Build Time: Jan 23 2007 09:37:14 local
  Description of problem:
  I installed k3d-all-in-one-setup-0.6.7.0.exe on a Vista buisiness AsusG2
  laptop
  with Nvidia geforce_8600M (1440x900)
  The viewport does not update or show at all
  I cannot rotate the view even if the grid shows.
  I have seen a reported framerate of 1000 or maybe even 4000 (can't repeat
  it right now)
  
  Steps to reproduce problem:
  Run the k3d-all-in-one-setup-0.6.7.0.exe installer on my system.
  Note:
  I did intall the components all in 1 directory on my D drive.
  
  How often does this happen?
  From the first run on.
  
  Additional information:
  I'm willing to test any (alpha) code that might solve this problem
  or can help to identify the bug.
  
  Cheers
  Willem.
