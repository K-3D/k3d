title: Selection issues when moving from 64-bit to 32-bit platforms.
desc: We store "select all" and "deselect all" operations as an assignment of selection weights to the entire range of values that can be stored in uint_t.  Because the range varies depending on platform word size, documents saved on a 64-bit platform cannot be deserialized on 32-bit platforms.
