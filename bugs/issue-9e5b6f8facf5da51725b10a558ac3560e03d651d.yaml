title: Rotate and Scale Tools don't work around correct center
desc: |-
  When using the scale or rotate tools on component selections such as faces,
  the tools don't rotate around the center of the selected geometry.
  
  In much earlier versions of k3d this used to work correctly. Something has
  changed.
  
  Tested in SVN from 2007 Nov 27th on Ubuntu Gnu/Linux 7.10 Gutsy.
