title: Normals flipped when extruding 0 m
desc: |-
  Summary: Normals are flipped (point inwards) when extruding a face 0m and
  moving the face afterwards via the move tool.
  
  Steps to reproduce:
  
  1. Create a cube (or whatever)
  2. Go into face mode and select a face
  3. Use the "Modify|Mesh|Extrude Faces" command
  4. Go into the Node Properties panel and change the distance value to "0
  m"
  5. Go into move mode (press w) and move the face manually. Than you will
  see that the normals of the newly created polygons of the extrusion point
  inwards.
