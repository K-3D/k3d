title: Modifiers break per-face attributes (among others)
desc: |-
  The way things work in RenderMan, you have a lot of
  flexibility
  to "tag" geometry with attributes of various types -
  colors, scalars,
  strings, normals, matrices, etc. You do this tagging
  at many levels:
  per-face, per-vertex, per-edge, etc. However, you do
  have to be
  consistent: if you provide (in this case) per-face
  colors for some
  faces, you must provide them for *all* faces.
  Polyhedron is doing that
  fine, but what's happening is that the subsequent
  ExtrudeFaces modifiers
  aren't assigning per-face colors for the new faces they
  create. So the
  RIB output produced by K-3D isn't valid in this case.
  
  The short-term workaround is to use the TagColors
  modifier with the "tag
  faces" property enabled, to assign colors to all the faces.
  
  I will add some sanity checking in our RIB output to
  catch this scenario
  and correct it.
  
  Longer-term, it's going to be a bear to fix all of the
  modifiers that
  aren't generating tags ... doh! But it'll have to be
  done. I will
  postpone it to after 0.6 because there are some other
  performance-related changes to k3d::mesh that will have
  an impact on the
  work.
