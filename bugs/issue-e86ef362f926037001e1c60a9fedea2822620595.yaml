title: "5  Array out of bounds in point painter "
desc: |-
  I'm not sure how to reproduce this, since it actually happened when my cat
  jumped up on the keyboard. :)
  
  Either way, in point_vbo::on_execute, an array range check failed on line
  114:
  glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(points[0]) * points.size(),
  &points[0], GL_STATIC_DRAW);
  
  It seems like the "points" array is empty, which means the points[0] will
  fail. Not sure if it's even supposed to get there if point size is zero,
  which is why someone who knows about it should have a look.
