  Description of problem:
  During the Panel Basics Tutorial, I clicked the green button that advances
  to the next step, and I recieved an 'Error executing script' message with
  an OK button. I clicked OK, and it closed the tutorial. I attempted to run
  the tutorial again, and the same event ocurred at the same point.
  
  Steps to reproduce problem:
  
  1. Help -> Tutorials and Examples -> Panel Basics
  2. Run through tutorial.
  
  Expected results:
  
  The tutorial runs...
  
  Actual results:
  
  After the step "The Tool Properties Panel is used to Display Tool-specific
  options (and resembles the Node Properties Panel) ...," pressing the green
  button to advance instead brings up the "Error executing script" window.
  
  How often does this happen?
  
  Every time i have tried running the tutorial.
