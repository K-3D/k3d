	  m_data, which is a reference.

	  share/netpbm.conf file so that exported TIFF files are always
	  24-bit color files (otherwise, the pnmtotiff filter will analyze
	  images for the number of colors they contain and write
	  reduced-bit-depth images where possible, which few RenderMan
	  engines will read).  * Created "Reporting Bugs" tutorial.

2002-12-14 13:07  jdmoline

	  displays * Fix: tutorial grease-pencil effect didn't always
	  line-up properly with widgets * Fix: couldn't cancel a tutorial *
	  Feature: clicking on a UI node in the Command Node Inspector
	  highlights it (good for adding grease-pencil effect when
	  recording tutorials)
