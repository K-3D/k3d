= Pipeline Basics =

== Overview ==

The fundamental organizing structure of K-3D is the 'Visualization Pipeline' K-3D user documents are made up of 'Nodes'  When you use a plugin, you are usually adding a new node to the document.  Each node created is a new instance of a specific plugin type.  We represent nodes diagrammatically as boxes, and label them based on either the node's type or its purpose:

["graphviz", "pipeline2.png"]
------------------------------------

digraph
{
graph [rankdir="LR"]
node [shape="box",fontname="Helvetica"]
A [label="Node"]
}

------------------------------------

Although there are exceptions, most nodes can be categorized as 'Sources' 'Modifiers' or 'Sinks' of data.  Sources create data, modifiers process data, and sinks consume data.  Thus, data ``flows'' from sources, is altered by modifiers, and terminates at sinks.  We can represent this flow using arrows:

["graphviz", "pipeline3.png"]
------------------------------------

digraph
{
graph [rankdir="LR"]
node [shape="box",fontname="Helvetica"]
Source -> Modifier -> Sink
}

------------------------------------

This is where the term 'Pipeline' originates - connections between nodes act as ``pipes'' and data flows through them like water.  Though it may not be obvious to the casual observer, all K-3D operations are performed using the pipeline, with human interaction converted into pipeline manipulations by the user interface layer.

As a concrete example, here is a typical example of a ``real'' pipeline:

["graphviz", "pipeline4.png"]
------------------------------------

digraph
{
graph [rankdir="LR"]
node [shape="box",fontname="Helvetica"]
PolyGrid [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/PolyGrid"]
ScalePoints [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/ScalePoints"]
MeshInstance [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/MeshInstance"]
PolyGrid -> ScalePoints -> MeshInstance
}

------------------------------------

In this example, the <<PolyGrid,PolyGrid>> plugin acts as a source, producing geometric data (in this case, a regular polygon grid).  The <<ScalePoints,ScalePoints>> plugin acts as a modifier, applying a scaling transformation to any geometry that passes through it.  Finally, the <<MeshInstance,MeshInstance>> plugin is a consumer of data, rendering geometric input to the screen as a 2D image.

Of course, the pipeline can grow to be as complex as needed ... for example, a pipeline can contain multiple modifiers:

["graphviz", "pipeline5.png"]
------------------------------------

digraph
{
graph [rankdir="LR"]
node [shape="box",fontname="Helvetica"]
PolyGrid [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/PolyGrid"]
RotatePoints [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/RotatePoints"]
ScalePoints [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/ScalePoints"]
MeshInstance [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/MeshInstance"]
PolyGrid -> ScalePoints -> RotatePoints ->MeshInstance
}

------------------------------------

Here, a second modifier - <<RotatePoints,RotatePoints>> - is added to the pipeline, further altering data after it is modified by <<ScalePoints,ScalePoints>>.  As you might imagine, you are free to chain-together modifiers in any number and combination desired.

== Fan-Out ==

The flexibility of the pipeline doesn't end there, however.  Pipelines can ``fan-out'', sending data to multiple destinations:

["graphviz", "pipeline6.png"]
------------------------------------

digraph
{
graph [rankdir="LR"]
node [shape="box",fontname="Helvetica"]
PolyGrid [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/PolyGrid"]
ScalePoints [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/ScalePoints"]
MeshInstance1 [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/MeshInstance"]
MeshInstance2 [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/MeshInstance"]
PolyGrid -> ScalePoints -> MeshInstance1
ScalePoints -> MeshInstance2
}

------------------------------------

In this case, the fan-out sends the scaled polygon data to two separate <<MeshInstance,MeshInstance>> nodes.  That means that the scene will contain two identical copies of the scaled data.

Note that there is no requirement that you fan-out to a data sink - the pipeline can be arbitrarily complex after the fan-out as-well-as before it:

["graphviz", "pipeline7.png"]
------------------------------------

digraph
{
graph [rankdir="LR"]
node [shape="box",fontname="Helvetica"]
PolyGrid [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/PolyGrid"]
RotatePoints [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/RotatePoints"]
ScalePoints [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/ScalePoints"]
MeshInstance1 [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/MeshInstance"]
MeshInstance2 [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/MeshInstance"]
PolyGrid -> ScalePoints -> MeshInstance1
ScalePoints -> RotatePoints -> MeshInstance2
}

------------------------------------

In this case, the output of the <<ScalePoints,ScalePoints>> node splits into two separate ``branches'' of the pipeline, but is further modified by <<RotatePoints,RotatePoints>> in the second branch.  Again, the pipeline could become arbitrarily complex, including further branches and modifiers.

== Fan-In ==

This is not the end of the story however, as pipelines can also ``fan-in'', merging two-or-more pipeline branches into a single branch:

["graphviz", "pipeline8.png"]
------------------------------------

digraph
{
graph [rankdir="LR"]
node [shape="box",fontname="Helvetica"]
PolyGrid [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/PolyGrid"]
PolySphere [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/PolySphere"]
MergeMesh [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/MergeMesh"]
ScalePoints [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/ScalePoints"]
MeshInstance [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/MeshInstance"]
PolyGrid -> MergeMesh -> ScalePoints -> MeshInstance
PolySphere -> MergeMesh
}

------------------------------------

In this case, the output of a second source - <<PolySphere,PolySphere>> - is merged with the output of <<PolyGrid,PolyGrid>> before their combined data is modified by <<ScalePoints,ScalePoints>> and displayed by the <<MeshInstance,MeshInstance>>.

== Properties ==

Next, we look at nodes in greater detail.  The vast majority of nodes contain 'Properties' which are the user-modifiable values that control a node's behavior.  Properties are displayed to the user in the <<Node Properties Panel>>, which lists a node's properties and provides controls for altering their values.

Properties can be connected to one another, and *those connections are what form the pipeline* - when you connect property ``A'' to property ``B'', changes to the value of property ``A'' are mirrored by property ``B'', as if the user had changed property ``B'' manually.

Now that we can see that connections among nodes are made via properties, we can provide additional detail in our diagrams by labeling properties that are connected:

["graphviz", "pipeline9.png"]
------------------------------------

digraph
{
graph [rankdir="LR"]
node [shape="box",fontname="Helvetica"]
edge [fontname="Helvetica",fontsize=10]
PolyGrid [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/PolyGrid"]
MeshInstance [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/MeshInstance"]
PolyGrid -> MeshInstance [ label="output_mesh > input_mesh" ]
}

------------------------------------

Note that we often leave-out details of which properties are connected, so long as the meaning of the diagram is unambiguous.

== Property Types ==

Note that K-3D properties are 'strongly typed' - that is to say that every property stores a specific type of data: a string, an integer number, a floating-point number, a boolean value, a bitmap image, geometry, etc.  The controls that are displayed by the user interface vary based on the property type.

Although the preceeding examples have focused on the flow of geometric data, there is nothing preventing other property types from being interconnected - in other words, any data type can move through the pipeline, so long as there are nodes that provide inputs and/or outputs for that type.  K-3D includes a number of image processing nodes that work with bitmap image data in the same way that other nodes work with geometric mesh data.  Strings, matrices, vectors, scalars, colors, etc. - all can flow through the visualization pipeline, affecting and being-affected-by the nodes they flow through.

The only limitation on property connections is that properties can only be connected to properties that share the same type - i.e. geometry properties can only be connected to other geometry properties, string properties can only be connected to string properties, etc.

== Property Roles ==

With our more detailed understanding of how properties are connected, we can adopt a more nuanced view of how the pipeline functions.  For example, we could connect the ``radius'' properties of two <<PolySphere,PolySphere>> sources:

["graphviz", "pipeline10.png"]
------------------------------------

digraph
{
graph [rankdir="TB"]
node [shape="box",fontname="Helvetica"]
edge [fontname="Helvetica",fontsize=10]
PolySphere1 [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/PolySphere"]
PolySphere2 [URL="http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/PolySphere"]
PolySphere1 -> PolySphere2 [ label="radius > radius"]
}

------------------------------------

Here, the primary function of the <<PolySphere,PolySphere>> nodes as mesh sources is unchanged, and we would likely connect their mesh outputs to other sink objects, but we have also introduced a ``constraint'' that the radius property of PolySphere2 will always ``follow'' the radius property of PolySphere1.

== Guidelines ==

The flexibility of the pipeline architecture exerts a strong influence on how components are designed and deployed in K-3D.  In particular, the pipeline places a strong premium on creating small, generic components instead of large, specialized components.  If a process can be broken-down into smaller steps, it should be - this makes it possible to substitute different components for individual steps in the process.  In this way users often come-up with surprising new ways of combining components to achieve interesting effects, something we wish to encourage.

In general, you should not be concerned about the user complexity of ``hooking up'' a pipeline composed of simple components - if a particular combination of components becomes ubiquitous, we will add logic to K-3D's user interface layer to simplify creating it.  Many complex pipeline-manipulation operations are "hidden" from users by the UI layer, but we always want to provide "power" users with the flexibility to setup the pipeline themselves.

== Property Loops ==

In K-3D 0.4, the Visualization Pipeline was called the 'Directed Acyclic Graph' or 'DAG', because it did not allow for circular dependencies among properties.  This limitation was removed in K-3D 0.5, leading to use of the term 'Directed Graph' or 'DG'.  See <<Visualization Pipeline Loops>> for a discussion on how loops in the pipeline behave.
